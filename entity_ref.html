        "It is not critic who counts;not the man who points out how the strong man
         stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.The credit
         belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,whose face is marred by 
         dustand sweat and blood;who strives valiantaly;who errs,who comes short 
         again and again,because there is no effort without error and shortcomin;
         but who does actually strive to do the deeds;who knows great enthusiasms,
         the great devotions;who spends himself in a worthy cause;who at the best
         knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,and who at the worst,if he
         fails,at least fails while daring greatly,so that his peace shall never be
         with those cold and timid souls who either know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat."
