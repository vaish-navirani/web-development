          <h4>Commenting</h4>
          <p>
            Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
            programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
            programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
            project you create. With proper comments and organised files its
            always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
            things are at and how they work.

          <h4>Always be Curious</h4>
          <p>
            A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated
            continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field. You
            need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end
            development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of

          <h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time</h4>
          <p>
            By “refactoring” your code, you are only enhancing the code without
            tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and
            readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your
            code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version
            of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant
            advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code
            remains free from plagiarism.

          <h4>Automate!</h4>
          <p>
            As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute
            little details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to
            invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow,
            dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment,
            and so on. Doesn't sound easy, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your
            workflow. While automation can take care of things such as
            optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
            front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side
            software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not
            only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use
            your time to focus on the areas that'll improve the overall
            functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very
            efficient automation tools.
